        rhododendron forests in the backdrop of snow-capped mountains. First,
        you will reach Ulleri village taking through a cool forest. Though the
        trek is long and tiring, all fatigue will melt away as you reach
        Ghorepani where you will be greeted by the Dhaulagiri mountain range.
        Ghorepani is a small settlement with many hotels providing good
        facilities for accommodation. Ghorepani is popular for the side trek to

        the Ghandruk trail meets.
      </div>
      <div className="this-is-a">
        This is a comparatively easy day, here we walk downhill mostly. We walk
        through the forest, cross a suspension bridge, and follow the trail
        along with beautiful little villages on the way. Chhomrong is the most
        developed village here, where one can get a coffee, bakery, etc. The
        hotels here are beautiful and comfortable. Chhomrong looks like an
        unreal place as one could only imagine unless you reach there. At
        Chhomrong, a breathtaking view of mountain peaks such as Annapurna,
        Macchapuchhre, and Himchuli can be enjoyed.

        village mainly popular for its natural hot spring. Tatopani Hot spring
        is believed to have healing power and to take away the aches and pains
        of the body. The location could not be any better as it provides perfect
        timing to get relief from the aches brought down from the trek.
